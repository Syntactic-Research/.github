## Syntactic Research

- We are a development team focused on building scalable lexers & parsers for hundreds of new programming languages.

The idea of having a custom programming language is a celebrated idea here at Syntactic, and you can make it happen.

Email Kai D. Gonzalez @ `gkai70264@gmail.com` to submit your state machines & lexers and maybe we'll consider putting it up on our page!
